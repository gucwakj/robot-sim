TODO File for iMobot Simulations

General:
	demos dir with ik_*.cpp and fd_*.cpp
	docs/, AUTHORS, README
	build class
		rename CiMobotSim to CiMobotFD
		create CiMobotBuild class to allow one build function per demo program
	CMakeLists.txt much smaller than cimobotsim_test/*

Forward Dynamics:
	Parallelize the code
		The gumstix aren't as fast as desktops and the simulations take a few
		seconds to run.  If not parallel, only one module can be doing work at a
		time leaving the others to sit idle.  When stringing multiple
		simulations together, this can add up.
	Weight distribution
		Values are currently guessed.  Need a more accurate distribution of
		weights from a cad model.  Started work based on Graham's cad model within
		solidedge to get weights and moments of inertia for each body part
		including all connectors, etc.  KG doesn't have experience with cad
		modeling to get it done quickly.
	Max Joint Force
		Values are guessed as well.  From a working RecurDyn model, need to get
		the max force which can be applied by the motors for each joint.  These values
		are set within ODE to stall a motor when it cant overcome a body.
	Max Joint Velocity
		Values are based upon Graham's calculations in his thesis.  Need experimental
		values true to the module.
	More accurate completion check
		Currently the code will only check if all of the joints have completed
		all of their scheduled positions.  For cases like the camera stand, if
		the body falls over, can still get a 'success' flag because the bodies
		have completed their motions.  However the module is obviously not in
		the right position.
	Wind
		Possibly add wind effects to the simulation.  A cross-wind would have an
		adverse effect especially on larger robots.  Found a link that simulated
		wind as a group of small spheres.

	New features from David
		PID
		Mismatched endcap rotation
	Implement bot as class not struct
		similar to IK classes, cleans up sim.cpp file
    target functions
        setTargetPosition()
        setTargetOrientation()
        drawTarget()

Inverse Kinematics:
	cleaner implementation of Jacobian type passing
		do we even need different (lesser) types like pseudoinverse, transpose?  removing
		them will allow other functions on Matrix and Vector classes to be removed
	const keyword used excessively
	properly clean up node_right array in destructor
	SDLS fails when num_rows > num_cols
        read up on how N, M are calculated and why they are looping over num_rows
    what is the meaning of the time variable
        can the two times be synced by limiting ik to a max joint movement per step
