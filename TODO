TODO File for iMobot Simulations

Forward Dynamics:
	Parallelize the code
		The gumstix aren't as fast as desktops and the simulations take a few
		seconds to run.  If not parallel, only one module can be doing work at a
		time leaving the others to sit idle.  When stringing multiple
		simulations together, this can add up.
	Weight distribution
		Values are currently guessed.  Need a more accurate distribution of
		weights from a cad model.  Started work based on Graham's cad model within
		solidedge to get weights and moments of inertia for each body part
		including all connectors, etc.  KG doesn't have experience with cad
		modeling to get it done quickly.
	Max Joint Force
		Values are guessed as well.  From a working RecurDyn model, need to get
		the max force which can be applied by the motors for each joint.  These values
		are set within ODE to stall a motor when it cant overcome a body.
	Max Joint Velocity
		Values are based upon Graham's calculations in his thesis.  Need experimental
		values true to the module.
