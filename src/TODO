TODO File for ODE Simulations

	Parallelize the code
		The gumstix aren't as fast as desktops and the simulations take a few
		seconds to run.  If not parallel, only one module can be doing work at a
		time leaving the others to sit idle.  When stringing multiple
		simulations together, this can add up.

	More realistic geometries for bodies
		Contact surfaces are based upon geoms for each body.  When initially
		building the modules, I went for simplicity.  However the large surfaces
		are all in contact and therefore the results are off.  Need to create an
		accurate set of aluminum pieces so that contacts mimic physical body.
	 -> Calibration Function takes care of this.  possible with new imobot module

	Weight distribution
		Values are currently guessed.  Need a more accurate distribution of
		weights from a cad model.  Started work based on Graham's cad model within
		solidedge to get weights and moments of inertia for each body part
		including all connectors, etc.  KG doesn't have experience with cad
		modeling to get it done quickly.

	Max Joint Force
		Values are guessed as well.  From a working RecurDyn model, need to get
		the max force which can be applied by the motors for each joint.  These values
		are set within ODE to stall a motor when it cant overcome a body.
	
	Max Joint Velocity
		Values are based upon Graham's calculations in his thesis.  Need experimental
		values true to the module.

	More accurate completion check
		Currently the code will only check if all of the joints have completed
		all of their scheduled positions.  For cases like the camera stand, if
		the body falls over, can still get a 'success' flag because the bodies
		have completed their motions.  However the module is obviously not in
		the right position.

	More complete return data
		Current list of data returned after execution is limited.  Need a bit
		more especially when putting into optimization code.

	Function to get current state
		When cutting a sim short possibly to start again with new parameters,
		need to get current state of bodies and output to a file/array

	Wind
		Possibly add wind effects to the simulation.  A cross-wind would have an
		adverse effect especially on larger robots.  Found a link that simulated
		wind as a group of small spheres.

	Put distance moved into Reply struct
		Need a means of knowing how far the iMobot moved during sim.  Is it
		needed for all body parts of all modules?  Lots of information to
		gather.  Could it be simplified with just the center?

	change names of private variables to m_
		small syntax thing which would make the code more readable

	Positioned build into ground
		Positioned build doesn't check whether or not the body is rotated into ground
		or not.  will bounce body once sim starts.  need to find a way to check the 
		lowest point of the body
